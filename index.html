            <h1>The History of the Android Mascot</h1>

            <p>You probably know that the <strong>Android</strong> operating system, maintained by <strong>Google</strong>, is one of the most widely used for mobile devices worldwide. But did you know that its friendly mascot has a name and a very curious history? Follow this article to learn all about this little robot!</p>

            <h2>The First Version</h2>

            <p>The first attempt to create a mascot appeared in 2007 and came from a developer named <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank" class="outside">Dan Morrill</a>. He says he opened <a href="https://inkscape.org" target="_blank" class="outside">Inkscape</a> (a free software for image vectorization) and created his own version of a robot. The goal was simply to personify the system for his team—there was no official request from the company to create a mascot.</p>

            <p>This bizarre first version was even named in honor of its creator: they were called the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.</p>

            <h2>A New Mascot Emerges</h2>

            <p>The idea of having a mascot started to mature, and the mission was handed over to a professional in the field. Russian illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com" target="_blank" class="outside">Irina Blok</a>, who was also a Google employee, was given the task of designing a more appealing version of the little robot.</p>

            </picture>

            <p>Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with simple strokes and a flat style. The design also had to create an immediate connection with those who saw it. And so, <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, the new Android mascot, was born.</p>

            <img src="images/bugdroid.png" class="small" alt="Bugdroid">

            <p>The primary inspiration for the new Bugdroid’s design came from the little stick figures used to indicate gender on restroom doors. According to legend, the artist was working at her desk in <strong>Google's</strong> office, glanced at the restroom signs, and had an instant realization: simple, clean, and direct.</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, <strong>Android Q</strong> never existed, as Google decided to end this fun tradition and began using numerical versions instead, starting with Android 10.</p>
